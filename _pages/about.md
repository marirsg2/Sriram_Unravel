I am an AI research lead at JP Morgan Chase. My work includes problems on company operations such as task assignment, scheduling, leveraging LLMs for company operations, generating synthetic data such as time-series data, and human-AI interaction. 
I was previously a phd student at Arizona State University in the [Yochan](https://yochan-lab.github.io/home/) lab under [Dr.Subbarao Kambhampati](http://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu/)
My primary focus is improving Human-AI interaction in sequential decision making problems. I integrate human biases, cognitive limitations and preferences into reinforcement learning, interactions with LLMs, optimization algorithms and planning/search. 

<!-- I will post articles that describe AI techniques in this light, in the hope that the understanding and perspectives shared might help build intuitions and give a better understanding of some dense approaches in AI . -->
