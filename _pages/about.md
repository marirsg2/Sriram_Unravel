I work on Automated Planning, and Human-AI interaction. My current research focuses on Human-Aware AI in sequential decision making (planning) problems. My work considers how human cognitive limitations can be incorporated into problem settings and algorithms for better Human-AI interaction. I also enjoy visualizing and understanding the theories that underpin AI techniques, especially in terms of information theory. If you'd like to know more about me, please check out my CV.

<!-- I will post articles that describe AI techniques in this light, in the hope that the understanding and perspectives shared might help build intuitions and give a better understanding of some dense approaches in AI . -->
