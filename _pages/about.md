I enjoy visualizing and understanding the theories that underpin AI techniques, especially
in terms of information theory. I work on Automated Planning, and Human-AI collaboration. My current research focuses on Human-Aware AI and leverages Automated Planning and Graph Theory to develop methods for improved Human-AI interaction. If you'd like to know more about me, please check out my CV.

<!-- I will post articles that describe AI techniques in this light, in the hope that the understanding and perspectives shared might help build intuitions and give a better understanding of some dense approaches in AI . -->
