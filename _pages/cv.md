[Curriculum Vitae](https://marirsg2.github.io/Sriram_Unravel/files/CV_Sriram.pdf)

======

I work at JP Morgan Chase as an AI Research Scientist. My research includes problems on company operations, generating synthetic data such as time-series data, and human-AI interaction. 
I was previously a phd student at Arizona State University in the [Yochan](https://yochan-lab.github.io/home/) lab under [Dr.Subbarao Kambhampati](http://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu/)
My primary focus is improving Human-AI interaction in sequential decision making problems. I integrate human biases, cognitive limitations and preferences into reinforcement learning , planning and optimization algorithms.
