About Me
======
I'm a phd student at Arizona State University in the [Yochan](https://yochan-lab.github.io/home/) lab under [Dr.Subbarao Kambhampati](http://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu/)
I work on Automated Planning, and Human-AI interaction. My current research focuses on Human-Aware AI in sequential decision making (planning) problems. My work considers how human cognitive limitations can be incorporated into problem settings and algorithms for better Human-AI interaction.
